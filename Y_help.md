## Where to Get Help

There are two really good places to get help if you have questions that these guides don't address.

#### The [phoenix-talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phoenix-talk) Mailing List

This is a google group dedicated to Phoenix framework discusssions, including any questions you might have. You can register to get emails of individual posts or digests.

#### The elixir-lang irc Channel on Freenode

The good people at elixir-lang are letting Phoenix developers use their channel for our discussions. If our numbers continue to grow, it may make more sense for us to split off into our own channel. For now, though, the elixir-lang channel is the place to chat about Phoenix or ask any questions you might have.
