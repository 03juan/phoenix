Most of this is stock HTML and CSS from the Readme.io website.

For the most part, the only changes you will need to make are in Phoenix_files/custom.scss.

Make sure to install Sass and then run `sass --watch Phoenix_files/custom.scss`

That will make sure to update the css as you are working on it.
